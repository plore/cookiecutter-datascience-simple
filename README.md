# Cookiecutter Data Science Simple

A template for simple data science projects.

Minimally opinionated, doesn't enforce much more than common Python code quality standards.
Provides some convenience options for working with Jupyter Notebooks.

### Requirements
- Python 3.11
### Usage
```sh
python -m pip install cookiecutter
python -m cookiecutter gh:plore/cookiecutter-datascience-simple
```
This cookiecutter uses [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html) for environment and dependencies management.
